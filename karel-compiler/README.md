# `karel-compiler`

The compiler for [karel.js](https://github.com/omegaup/karel.js). It also
exposes a [CST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_Syntax_Tree) interfaces
for pretty-printers. It uses the [Chevrotain Parser Building Toolkit for
JavaScript](https://github.com/SAP/chevrotain) as parser, and a CST visitor as
compiler.
